# Machine Learning
This section is concerned with general machine learning packages. A separate section (link to section) exists for 
packages that only concern themselves with the sub-domain of Neural Networks.  
Relevant packages: MLJ.jl, SciKitLearn.jl KNet.jl, HorseML

This section is not yet written. If you have used or developed Julia packages in this domain, we would love your help!
